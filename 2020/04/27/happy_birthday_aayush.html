<p>Well, Thank you.</p>

<h1 id="lets-begin">LETS BEGIN</h1>

<p>The link - “bit.ly/<strong>__</strong>_”</p>

<p>Figure out the next seven characters after ‘/’</p>

<ul>
  <li>The characters might be digits or capital letters</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="character-1-digit-">Character 1 (Digit)-</h2>

<p>You have heard it, so you would know…<br />
Let those memory cells in you flow…</p>

<p>It is the first character of a famous song…<br />
If you try hard, you won’t be wrong.</p>

<p>Song - 
<img src="images/guns.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you still don’t get it…you are not really keen. <br />
I hope your day still may be green.</p>

<h2 id="character-2-capital-letter">Character 2 (Capital Letter)</h2>

<p>Well, you figured that out?</p>

<p><img src="images/np.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I hope you are a fan of Natalie Portman. Because Why not?</p>

<p>So, Jimit shaved his head for this qurantine.<br />
And so did Natalie Portman’s character for this movie</p>

<p>Guess the movie and there you will have your character as well.</p>

<p>Also, V all really love you.</p>

<h2 id="character-3-capital-letter">Character 3 (Capital Letter)</h2>

<p>Are you hating this quiz, well then - 
<img src="images/bp.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>While we were scared that Word War 3 might break out…</p>

<p>The guy from “I hate Rachel Green Club” was fighting a different world war altogether”</p>

<p>Guess his war and there you shall have it. <br />
If not, then come on - think a bit</p>

<h2 id="character-4-digit">Character 4 (Digit)</h2>

<p>We all just need a million dollars (Not Jimit though).</p>

<p>Or maybe we just need to find the one Rachel out there for us as well? But, what if she might be a lesbian?</p>

<p><img src="images/pilot.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>“<strong><em>The _________ where it all began</em></strong>”</p>

<h2 id="character-5-capital-letter">Character 5 (Capital Letter)</h2>

<p>Now, there is no time to halt…
The clue here is the final QUEEN in the North.</p>

<p>She also played Phoenix (Jean Grey) in the Movie: X-Men
Now, this will be figured out even by a layman…</p>

<p>2nd letter of the Last Name of this girl.</p>

<p>Among other things, she also has a “Derani-Jethani” relationship with our girl - PC</p>

<p><img src="images/pc.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="character-6-digit">Character 6 (Digit)</h2>

<p>The episode that Michael left the office was such a tearjerker.</p>

<p><img src="images/mc.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We still miss him so dearly. He was a part of Office. 
He worked there for so much time. Similar to watching Die Hard 80000 times.</p>

<p>How much time exactly? How many minutes? I just don’t recollect it.</p>

<p>The character is just middle digit of that number?</p>

<p>Also, after going to end up wherever we go, <strong><em>Remember to Call</em></strong><br />
Or, it’s going to hurt like a motherfucker.</p>

<h2 id="character-7-capital-letter">Character 7 (Capital Letter)</h2>

<p>TED’s secret identity in How I Met your Mother. <br />
Pirate DJ Doctor _ (Real Fan of the band - DISHWALLA) <br /></p>

<p>Or just -</p>

<p><img src="images/x.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>James McAvoy at the Xavier’s school for gifted Youngsters.  <br />
Come on now…this couldn’t get any easier.</p>
