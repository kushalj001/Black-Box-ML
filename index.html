This is my blog where I try to distil NLP/ML concepts to the best of my ability and write about my research. I try to use intuitions and illustrations to understand complex concepts in NLP/ML. 
There is nothing new here just better explanations for somethings. You can reach out to me on twitter for collaboration on NLP ideas.
