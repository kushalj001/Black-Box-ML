    "## Introduction\n",
    "The aim of this post is to enable beginners to get started with building sequential models in PyTorch. PyTorch is one of the most widely used deep learning libraries and is an extremely popular choice among researchers due to the amount of control it provides to its users and its _pythonic_ layout. I am writing this primarily as a resource that I can refer to in future. This post will help in brushing up all the basics of PyTorch and also provide a detailed explanation of how to use some important torch.nn modules.   \n",
    "We will be implementing a common NLP task - sentiment analysis using PyTorch and torchText. We will be building an LSTM network for the task by using the IMDB dataset. Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Tensor based approach\n",
    "Another motivation to write this post is to introduce neural nets from tensors' persepective. Neural nets are, ultimately, a series of matrix/tensor multiplications. Each layer in a neural net expects an input in a specified format and gives the output in a specified format. These input and output formats are tensors of different shapes. The content of these tensors are well defined by the documentation of the concerned library. As such, while implementing neural nets, it becomes very important to understand the input and output shapes of tensors for all layers. The following tutorial is written based on this approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "## A short Introduction to NLP pipeline\n",
    "I do not intend to go into details about all the preprocessing steps that are required for NLP tasks but for the sake of completeness, I'll summarize some important conceptual points. \n",
    "* Textual data usually requires some amount of cleaning before they can be fed to neural nets. Important cleaning steps include removal of HTML tags, punctuation, stopwords, numbers etc. Stopwords are high frequency words in a dataset that do not convey significant information to the network (e.g. and, of, the, a).\n",
    "* Lemmatization can be performed to improve results of the network. Lemmatization converts words to their root form or to their lemma which can be found in a dictionary. For example \"goes\" $->$ \"go\".\n",
    "* Neural nets do not understand natural language. In fact the only thing they understand and can process are numbers. So for any NLP task, we need to convert out text data into a numerical format (numericalization). Each word in the dataset is assigned a numerical value. These words need to be represented as a vector.\n",
    "* There are two options to represent a word or a token as a feature vector.  \n",
    "   1. One-hot encoding: Here, the size of the feature vector equals that of the vocabulary of dataset. All the values are 0 except for the index that equals the numerical value of the word.  \n",
    "   2. Embeddings: These can either be pre-trained(GloVe, word2vec) or be trained in parallel with the main task. The dimensions of such vectors are usually around 100-300. These transform the features of the word into a dense vector.\n",

    "## TorchText basics\n",
    "Some key points about the structure of the library will serve as a good introduction and also help in following along the rest of the tutorial.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important class of torchtext is the `Field` class. The structure of datasets for different NLP tasks is different. For example, in a classification task we have text reviews that are sequential in nature and a sentiment label corresponding to each review which is binary in nature (+ or -). In machine translation or summarization, both the input and output are sequential. The `Field` class handles all such types of datasets. Therefore, we initialize `Field` objects for each type of data format present in our dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In sentiment analysis we need two `Field` instances - one for text review and other for labels. For labels we use `LabelField` which inherits from `Field`. Following are some important parameters you might need while initializing a Field class.\n",
    "   - `tokenize`   : function used to tokenize the text. This can either be a custom function or passing 'spacy' uses the    SpaCy tokenizer.\n",
    "   - `init_token` : prepends this token in the beginning of each example. e.g. < sos >.\n",
    "   - `eos_token`  : appends this token in the end of each example. e.g. < eos >.\n",
    "   - `fix_length` : fixed, predefined length to which all the examples in field will be padded.\n",
    "   - `batch_first`: gives data in tensors that have batch dimension as the first dimension.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "Some important methods:\n",
    "   - `pad()` :  This method pads the examples to `fix_length` if provided as a parameter. If not, it calculates the length of the largest example in a batch and pads the sequences to that length.\n",
    "   - `build_vocab()`: The Field class holds an instance of Vocab class. This class is responsible for creating a vocabulary from the field data and creating mappings stoi (string to int) and itos (int to string) for each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the Field class numericalizes the text data and provides it in form of tensors so that they can be used easily with neural nets."
