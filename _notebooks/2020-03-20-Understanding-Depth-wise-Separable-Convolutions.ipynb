    "Depthwise separable convolutions serve the same purpose as normal convolutions with the only difference being that they are faster because they reduce the number of multiplication operations. This is done by breaking the convolution operation into two parts: depthwise convolution and pointwise convolution.\n",

    "The number of multiplications for a single convolution operation is the number of elements inside the kernel. This is $D_{K}$ X $D_{K}$ X $M$ = $D_{K}^{2}$ X $M$.\n",
    "To get the output feature map, we slide or convolve this kernel over the input. Given the output dimensions, we perform $D_{O}$ covolutions along the width and the height of the input image. Therefore, the number of multiplications per kernel are $D_{O}^{2}$ X $D_{K}^{2}$ X $M$.   \n",

Therefore the number of multiplications in a single convolution operation would be $D_{K}^{2}$ X $1$. If the output dimension is $D_{O}$, then the number of multiplications per kernel are $D_{K}^{2}$ X $D_{O}^{2}$. If there are $M$ input channels, we need to use $M$ such kernels, one kernel for each input channel to get the all the features.
