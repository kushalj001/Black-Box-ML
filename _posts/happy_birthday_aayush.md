Figure out the next seven characters after '/'

## Character 1 (Digit)-

I hope your day still may be green.

I hope you are a fan of Natalie Portman. Because Why not?

So, Jimit shaved his head for this qurantine.  
And so did Natalie Portman's character for this movie

Guess the movie and there you will have your character as well.

Also, V all really love you.

## Character 3 (Capital Letter)

Are you hating this quiz, well then -

While we were scared that Word War 3 might break out...

The guy from "I hate Rachel Green Club" was fighting a different world war altogether"

Guess his war and there you shall have it.   
If not, then come on - think a bit

## Character 4 (Digit)

We all just need a million dollars (Not Jimit though).

Or maybe we just need to find the one Rachel out there for us as well? But, what if she might be a lesbian?

"***The _\_\_\_\_____ where it all began***"

## Character 5 (Capital Letter)

Now, there is no time to halt...
The clue here is the final QUEEN in the North. 

She also played Phoenix (Jean Grey) in the Movie: X-Men
Now, this will be figured out even by a layman...

2nd letter of the Last Name of this girl. 

Among other things, she also has a "Derani-Jethani" relationship with our girl - PC

## Character 6 (Digit)

The episode that Michael left the office was such a tearjerker.

We still miss him so dearly. He was a part of Office. 
He worked there for so much time. Similar to watching Die Hard 80000 times.

How much time exactly? How many minutes? I just don't recollect it. 

The character is just middle digit of that number?

Also, after going to end up wherever we go, ***Remember to Call***  
Or, it's going to hurt like a motherfucker. 

## Character 7 (Capital Letter)

TED's secret identity in How I Met your Mother. <br>
Pirate DJ Doctor _ (Real Fan of the band - DISHWALLA) <br>


Or just -
