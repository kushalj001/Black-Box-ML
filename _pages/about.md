I am a Computer Science undergrad at Mumbai University, India. I have been working on ML/NLP problems for over 2 years now. I am currently working as a research intern at [NeuralSpace AI](https://neuralspace.ai/). A brief explanation of my work at NeuralSpace.
* Currently working on a variety of NLP tasks for Indic-languages. 
* Developed a document analysis library from scratch. Involves a pipeline that takes in an image and returns all named-entities present in the image. Currently supports template-matching-based entity recognition for any type of PDF document. Also supports the analysis of documents with tabular data.
* Developed a multilingual text summarization model that works for 21 languages including 11 Indian languages.   
* Worked on machine translation of low resource languages to English.  

I like to read and implement research papers. My independent research projects include:
* Implemented/annotated 3 papers for the task of [Question Answering](https://github.com/kushalj001/pytorch-question-answering) viz. DrQA, BiDAF, and QANet. Each implementation is in the form of a tutorial with detailed explanations about each component/layer. Was included in the dair.ai [newsletter](https://dair.ai/NLP_Newsletter_12_en/).  
* Worked on Joint video summarization and captioning using multi-task learning as part of my undergrad thesis.  
* Co-authored a paper with my colleague [Fenil Doshi](https://github.com/fenil25) titled Stance Detection using Transformer Architectures and Temporal Convolutional Networks. Accepted at [IC4S](http://www.ic4s.org/) and yet to be published.  
  
I have previously worked as an SDE intern at [Neebal Technologies](https://www.neebal.com/) where I integrated a handwriting recognition engine into an android app. Worked with various Android APIs like BLE, JobScheduler, etc.  Since my sophomore year, I have been a part of a tiered student organization at my college called [Unicode](https://github.com/djunicode) where we develop open source software projects. As a project guide, I mentored sophomores to build an android-based attendance [application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.djunicode.attendanceapp&hl=en_US) for my department. 

I am an avid football and Arsenal follower. I also like to read about Indian history and finding out about events and various philosophies that have shaped the world we currently live in.
